### Things I've tried for feature engineering: 
I started by looking at a correlation heat map of the features in the dataset. There were features that had almost no correlation with the target variable so I decided to drop those.

Dropped uncorrelated features, onehot encoded categorical features, added statistical features

### Things I've tried for classifying:

blend of Xgboost, lightgbm, stacking ensemble model
